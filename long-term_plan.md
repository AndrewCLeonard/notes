# My Values

I am extending my spreadsheet fluency into Python, not starting over.

**Constraints:**

- All learning must directly replace an existing manual workflow or reduce operational risk.
- I prioritize correctness, reuse, and clarity over speed or novelty.

> 3 = Mission-critical to growth (builds reusable skills/assets)  
> 2 = High-value enablers (support systems that accelerate 3’s)  
> 1 = Necessary ops (keeps the lights on; little skill growth)  
> 0 = Avoidance / drift (busywork, rabbit holes)

## 3 — Mission-Critical

- Python fluency (Pandas, regex, reusable functions)
- SQL depth (joins, window functions, EXPLAIN)
- APIs/connectors (`gspread`, psycopg3, AB API)
- Testing/reproducibility (`pytest`, regression datasets)
- Shipping artifacts (CLI, notebooks others can run)
- Git:
  - working in branches,
  - opening/merging PRs,
  - resolving conflicts,
  - rebasing,
  - reverting,
  - tagging releases

## 2 — High-Value Enablers

- Project scaffolding (READMEs, `.env`, Makefile, configs)
- Dev environment & workflow (venv/poetry, VS Code setup)
- Architecture/communication (UML, design docs)
- Light performance exploration (timing, profiling)
- Git:
  - repo setup,
  - `.gitignore`,
  - commit conventions,
  - simple CI hooks

## 1 — Necessary Ops

- Spreadsheet cleaning, ad-hoc dashboards
- Manual fixes/data entry, status reports with no artifact
- Minor repo housekeeping (renames, file moves)
- Git:
  - typo/doc-only commits,
  - formatting-only commits

## 0 — Avoidance / Drift

- Endless formatting or reorganizing notes without output
- Tool shopping/tinkering without a concrete need
- Premature optimization / yak-shaving
- Reading tutorials without implementing
- Git:
  - bikeshedding commit messages,
  - force-pushing to shared branches

## Coding Slang

- **yak-shaving:** getting stuck doing a long chain of side-tasks before the _real_ task (e.g., “to write tests I need a linter → to set up the linter I need a config → to…”). useful awareness; try to time-box or defer.
- **bikeshedding:** spending lots of time on trivial choices (like colors, naming) because they’re easy to argue about, while hard/important work gets sidelined. notice it and move on.
