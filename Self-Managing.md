## Understanding Assignments

## "Just Mop the Floor"

As a new developer, take the assigned task and do it. Think of it like:

- mopping a floor
- washing windows
- doing dishes

Bootcamps and the internet do us a disservice by filling our heads with too much junk and complexity. If your job is to do some dishes, you don't first talk to your manager about the right kind of dishwasher to get. No, you get started on the task and just do it. When the bootcamps so heavily emphasize GitHub Projects, Sprints, etc., they add needless complexity. If your org uses Projects or Trello, then use it exactly as you've been assigned to check things off as done.
